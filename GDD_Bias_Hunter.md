## 1. Core Loop

### Minute-to-Minute Gameplay
- **Exploration Phase** (2-3 minutes): Navigate atmospheric 3D environments seeking AI-generated content manifestations
- **Detection Phase** (1-2 minutes): Use specialized tools to analyze suspicious content for bias patterns
- **Boss Battle Phase** (3-5 minutes): Engage in epic confrontations with bias "colossi" - massive manifestations of systematic bias
- **Research Integration** (1-2 minutes): Document findings and contribute to real research databases

### Primary Player Actions
1. **Environmental Navigation**: Third-person exploration with parkour mechanics inspired by Genshin Impact
2. **Bias Scanning**: Use AR-style overlay tools to detect hidden bias patterns in the environment
3. **Pattern Assembly**: Puzzle-solving to identify and connect bias manifestations across multiple data sources
4. **Colossus Combat**: Shadow of the Colossus-style battles where players must identify and exploit bias "weak points"
5. **Research Documentation**: Real-time logging of discoveries that contribute to actual AI safety research

### Session Objectives
- Complete 3-5 exploration areas per session
- Defeat 1 major bias colossus
- Discover and catalog 10-15 unique bias patterns
- Contribute 5-10 validated research findings
- Unlock new areas through accumulated knowledge

## 2. Mechanics Integration

### BiasDetectionController Integration
```csharp
// Enhanced for 3D exploration mechanics
public class BiasHunterController : BiasDetectionController 
{
    [Header("Bias Hunter Specific")]
    public BiasColossusBehavior currentColossus;
    public BiasPatternScanner scanner;
    public EnvironmentalBiasManager environmentManager;
    
    // New game mechanics
    public async Task InitializeHuntingEnvironment(BiasEnvironmentData envData)
    {
        // Setup 3D environment with bias manifestations
        await environmentManager.LoadEnvironment(envData);
        scanner.InitializePatterns(envData.biasPatterns);
        
        // Integrate with existing pattern recognition
        await SetupPatternRecognitionMechanics();
    }
    
    // Enhanced boss battle mechanics
    public void EngageColossus(BiasType biasType)
    {
        currentColossus = BiasColossusFactory.CreateColossus(biasType);
        currentColossus.InitializeBattle(scenarios, this);
        TransitionToColossusMode();
    }
}
```

### ResearchGameManager Integration
- **Research Workflow Enhancement**: Each discovered bias pattern triggers real research contribution prompts
- **Session Tracking**: Extended session data to include exploration metrics, pattern discovery rate, and combat performance
- **Difficulty Adaptation**: Dynamic adjustment based on player's bias detection accuracy and research contribution quality

### New Controller Requirements
```csharp
public class EnvironmentalBiasManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public List<BiasManifestationNode> manifestationNodes;
    public BiasColossusSpawner colossusSpawner;
    
    public void SpawnBiasPatterns(BiasEnvironmentData data);
    public void UpdateManifestationVisibility(float playerSkillLevel);
    public BiasColossus SpawnColossus(BiasType type, Vector3 position);
}

public class BiasPatternScanner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScannerUI scannerInterface;
    public PatternVisualization patternViz;
    
    public ScanResult ScanForBias(Vector3 position, float radius);
    public void HighlightBiasPattern(BiasPattern pattern);
    public bool ValidatePlayerDetection(Vector3 position, BiasType expectedBias);
}
```

## 3. Art & Style Direction

### Visual Style: "Ethereal Bias Landscapes"
**Core Aesthetic**: Blend of Genshin Impact's vibrant fantasy world with Horizon Forbidden West's tech-nature fusion

**Environment Design**:
- **Bias Forests**: Organic environments where AI training data manifests as glowing trees, each branch representing different data sources
- **Information Valleys**: Sweeping landscapes of flowing data streams, with bias manifestations appearing as corrupted/discolored flows
- **Colossus Arenas**: Massive, cathedral-like spaces where bias colossi emerge from the data landscape itself

**Bias Visualization System**:
- **Confirmation Bias**: Manifests as mirror-like surfaces that only reflect what players expect to see
- **Selection Bias**: Appears as incomplete pathways and missing terrain chunks
- **Anchoring Bias**: Visualized as massive gravitational wells that distort surrounding data flows
- **Availability Heuristic**: Presented as overly bright, attention-grabbing phenomena that mask subtle patterns

**Character & Tools Design**:
- **Player Avatar**: Customizable "Bias Hunter" with archaeologist-meets-data-scientist aesthetic
- **Scanner Tool**: AR-style visor with holographic displays showing bias pattern analysis
- **Combat Gear**: Ethereal weapons that "purify" bias rather than destroy, maintaining educational focus

### Audio Direction
- **Environmental Audio**: Procedural soundscapes that shift based on bias density and type
- **Bias Signature Sounds**: Each bias type has unique audio fingerprints (harmonic distortions, rhythm patterns)
- **Interactive Music**: Dynamic score that adapts to player's detection accuracy and exploration success
- **Educational Audio**: Optional explanatory narration for bias patterns, delivered by AI ethics experts

### UI/UX Design
- **Scanner Interface**: Inspired by Metroid Prime's scanning system with educational overlays
- **Pattern Library**: Visual encyclopedia of discovered biases, similar to Zelda's compendium
- **Research Dashboard**: Real-time integration showing player's contributions to actual research studies
- **Colossus Health System**: Shows bias "corruption levels" rather than traditional health bars
