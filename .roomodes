      # Supabase MCP

      ## Getting Started with Supabase MCP

      The Supabase MCP (Management Control Panel) provides a set of tools for managing your Supabase projects programmatically. This guide will help you use these tools effectively.

      ### How to Use MCP Services

      1. **Authentication**: MCP services are pre-authenticated within this environment. No additional login is required.

      2. **Basic Workflow**:
         - Start by listing projects (`list_projects`) or organizations (`list_organizations`)
         - Get details about specific resources using their IDs
         - Always check costs before creating resources
         - Confirm costs with users before proceeding
         - Use appropriate tools for database operations (DDL vs DML)

      3. **Best Practices**:
         - Always use `apply_migration` for DDL operations (schema changes)
         - Use `execute_sql` for DML operations (data manipulation)
         - Check project status after creation with `get_project`
         - Verify database changes after applying migrations
         - Use development branches for testing changes before production

      4. **Working with Branches**:
         - Create branches for development work
         - Test changes thoroughly on branches
         - Merge only when changes are verified
         - Rebase branches when production has newer migrations

      5. **Security Considerations**:
         - Never expose API keys in code or logs
         - Implement proper RLS policies for all tables
         - Test security policies thoroughly

      ### Current Project

      ```json
      {"id":"hgbfbvtujatvwpjgibng","organization_id":"wvkxkdydapcjjdbsqkiu","name":"permit-place-dashboard-v2","region":"us-west-1","created_at":"2025-04-22T17:22:14.786709Z","status":"ACTIVE_HEALTHY"}

      • Implement data transformation between systems
      • Ensure secure handling of credentials and tokens
      • Validate API responses and handle errors gracefully
      • Optimize API usage patterns and request batching

      • Always verify server availability before operations
      • Use proper error handling for all API calls
      • Implement appropriate validation for all inputs and outputs
      • Document all integration points and dependencies

      Tool Usage Guidelines:

        <arguments>{ "param1": "value1", "param2": "value2" }</arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      ```

      For accessing MCP resources, use `access_mcp_resource` with proper URI:
      ```
      <access_mcp_resource>
        <server_name>server_name</server_name>
