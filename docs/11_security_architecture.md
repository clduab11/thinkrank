## Container Security Architecture

### Pod Security Standards

ThinkRank implements Kubernetes Pod Security Standards with enhanced security contexts:

```yaml
# Enhanced security context implementation
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  runAsGroup: 1001
  fsGroup: 1001
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
```

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks
- Limits container breakout risks
- Enforces least privilege principle
- Provides defense in depth

### Container Capabilities Management

**Dropped Capabilities**:
- `ALL` capabilities dropped by default
- Prevents kernel-level exploits
- Reduces attack surface

**Resource Limitations**:
- Memory and CPU limits enforced
- Ephemeral storage restrictions
- No privileged container access

## Network Security Policies

### Namespace Isolation

Network policies ensure strict traffic control between namespaces:

```yaml
# Network policy for auth service
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: auth-service-secure-policy
  namespace: thinkrank
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth-service
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: thinkrank
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3001
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: postgres-encrypted
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
```

**Policy Enforcement**:
- Default deny all traffic
- Explicit allow rules only
- Encrypted communication required
- Service mesh integration

## Service Mesh Security

### Istio Service Mesh Integration

**Mutual TLS (mTLS)**:
- Automatic certificate management
- Traffic encryption in transit
- Identity-based authentication
- Policy-driven access control

**Security Policies**:
```yaml
# Istio authorization policy
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: auth-service-policy
  namespace: thinkrank
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth-service
  rules:
  - key: request.headers[authorization]
    values: ["Bearer *"]
  - key: source.ip
    values: ["10.0.0.0/8"]
```

**Benefits**:
- Zero-trust networking
- Encrypted service-to-service communication
- Fine-grained access control
- Traffic observability

## Database Security

### PostgreSQL Encryption

**Transparent Data Encryption**:
- Database-level encryption enabled
- Automatic encryption of data at rest
- Secure key management
- Backup encryption

**Connection Security**:
```yaml
# Encrypted PostgreSQL configuration
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: postgres-encrypted
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        env:
        - name: POSTGRESQL_ENABLE_TDE
          value: "yes"
        - name: POSTGRESQL_TDE_WALLET_PATH
          value: "/etc/wallet"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wallet-volume
          mountPath: /etc/wallet
          readOnly: true
```

**Access Controls**:
- Row-level security policies
- Database user privilege separation
- Connection pooling security
- Audit logging enabled

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Monitoring Architecture

**Prometheus Security Metrics**:
- Authentication failure rates
- Authorization violations
- Network policy breaches
- Container security events

**Alert Configuration**:
```yaml
# Security alerting rules
groups:
- name: security-alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighAuthenticationFailures
    expr: rate(auth_failures_total[5m]) > 10
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High authentication failure rate detected"
  - alert: UnauthorizedAccess
    expr: rate(authz_denials_total[5m]) > 5
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Unauthorized access attempts detected"
```

**Incident Response Integration**:
- Automated alert routing
- Security team notifications
- Escalation procedures
- Audit trail maintenance

## Feature Flag Security

### Secure Feature Rollout

**Gradual Rollout Strategy**:
- Percentage-based feature releases
- Environment-specific toggles
- Emergency kill switches
- A/B testing security controls

**Configuration Management**:
```yaml
# Secure feature flag configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: feature-flags-security
  namespace: thinkrank
data:
  FEATURE_MFA_REQUIRED: "false"  # Gradual rollout
  FEATURE_ENCRYPTED_SESSIONS: "true"  # Mandatory
  FEATURE_SECURITY_AUDIT_LOG: "true"  # Mandatory
  FEATURE_RATE_LIMITING: "true"  # Mandatory
```

**Access Control**:
- Feature flag modification restrictions
- Audit logging of flag changes
- Approval workflows for sensitive features
- Rollback capabilities

## Mobile Security Architecture

### Unity Client Security

**Secure Storage Implementation**:
- Platform-specific keystore integration
- Encrypted local data storage
- Secure token management
- Certificate pinning

**Network Security**:
```csharp
// Secure Unity WebSocket configuration
public class SecureWebSocketManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void ConfigureSecurity()
    {
        // Certificate pinning
        ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback =
            CertificateValidationCallback;

        // TLS 1.3 enforcement
        System.Net.ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol =
            SecurityProtocolType.Tls13;
    }

    private bool CertificateValidationCallback(
        object sender,
        X509Certificate certificate,
        X509Chain chain,
        SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
    {
        // Implement certificate pinning logic
        return IsValidCertificate(certificate);
    }
}
```
