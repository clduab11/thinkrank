## Security Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: RSA256 JWT Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Approved
**Priority**: Critical

#### Context
Previous authentication system used symmetric JWT tokens stored in environment variables, creating single point of failure and key management complexity. Critical vulnerability identified where tokens could be compromised through environment exposure.

#### Decision
Implement RSA256 asymmetric JWT tokens with separate public/private key pairs for enhanced security and scalability.

#### Rationale
- **Security**: Asymmetric keys eliminate single point of failure in symmetric key storage
- **Scalability**: Public keys can be distributed across services without exposing private keys
- **Industry Standard**: RSA256 is OWASP-recommended for JWT signing
- **Key Rotation**: Enables independent key rotation without service coordination

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enhanced security posture, simplified key management, compliance with security standards
- **Negative**: Increased token size (256 bytes vs 64 bytes for HS256), additional key management overhead

#### Implementation Details
- Private keys stored securely using sealed-secrets in Kubernetes
- Public keys distributed via ConfigMaps for service consumption
- Token verification optimized with caching layer for performance
- Key rotation strategy: 90-day rotation cycle with 30-day overlap period

#### Decision
Implement Redis-backed distributed rate limiting with progressive limits and security-focused sliding windows.

#### Rationale
- **Security**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks through request throttling
- **Performance**: Redis backend enables distributed rate limiting across service instances
- **Flexibility**: Progressive limits allow normal usage while preventing abuse
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics for security analysis and capacity planning

#### Consequences

#### Rationale
- **Security**: Consistent security policies across all services
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for security configuration
- **Compliance**: Centralized audit trail for configuration changes
- **Operational**: Reduced configuration drift and deployment errors

#### Consequences
