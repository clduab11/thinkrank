## üì± Mobile Development Recommendations

### 1. Cross-Platform Strategy
**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid Strategy
- **Primary:** React Native for core app functionality
- **Gaming:** Continue Unity for game components
- **Native:** Platform-specific features where needed

**Rationale:**
- Leverage existing TypeScript expertise
- Faster development and maintenance
- Better integration with existing React frontend
- Unity can be embedded for gaming components

### 2. Mobile Architecture Patterns
- **Clean Architecture:** Domain-driven design with clear separation
- **MVVM Pattern:** For React Native screens
- **Repository Pattern:** For data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection:** For testability and flexibility

### 3. Mobile Security Implementation
```typescript
// Certificate Pinning
const certificatePinner = new CertificatePinner([
  'sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=',
  'sha256/BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB='
]);

// Secure Storage
import { SecureStorage } from 'react-native-keychain';
await SecureStorage.setItem('auth_token', token);

// Device Security
import { isRooted, isJailbroken } from 'react-native-device-info';
if (isRooted() || isJailbroken()) {
  // Handle compromised device
}
```

### 4. Mobile CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/mobile.yml
name: Mobile Build & Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
jobs:
  build-ios:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup React Native
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-react-native
      - name: Build iOS
        run: cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace ...
      - name: Deploy to TestFlight
        uses: apple-actions/upload-testflight-build@v1
  
  build-android:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

## üîß Infrastructure Modernization

### 1. Container Security
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build with security hardening
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S thinkrank -u 1001

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
USER thinkrank
COPY --from=builder --chown=thinkrank:nodejs /app ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 2. Kubernetes Security
