## 🦾 Why ThinkRank, why now?

- AI is everywhere—so are deepfakes, bias, and hallucinations.
- Most tools teach features; ThinkRank trains judgment.
- You’ll master bias detection, research workflows, and ethical AI—while contributing valuable research data that advances AI safety.

---

## 🔥 Core gameplay that teaches (and sticks)

### Gacha‑style progression (designed for learning, not luck)
Collect challenge packs across five transparent rarity tiers that map to learning depth—not paywalls:
- Common: starter drills that build pattern recognition
- Uncommon: context and prompt‑sensitivity challenges
- Rare: cross‑modal (text + image) detection scenarios
- Epic: nuanced bias/ethics tradeoff simulations
- Legendary: expert‑level research investigations, time‑boxed and collaborative

What drops:
- Challenge Packs: curated sets by topic (bias, provenance, safety)
- Insight Cards: distilled lessons unlocked from your play
- Research Threads: community investigations you can join and rank in

Odds are published in‑app. No pay‑to‑win. Progress is skill‑based and education‑first.

### Bias detection challenges
- Spot subtle linguistic tells, stylistic artifacts, and sampling biases
- Compare model outputs, trace likely training influences
- Calibrate confidence and justify decisions under uncertainty

### Real‑time research workflows
- Validate sources, triangulate claims, and cite evidence
- Log reasoning steps; receive instant feedback and exemplars
- Join live investigations of trending AI‑generated content

### Viral features that amplify learning
- Social sharing of Insight Cards and clutch solves
- Global leaderboards, seasons, and achievement streaks
- Party play and classroom modes for cohort learning

## 🎓 Your learning arc

- Onboarding: fast calibration of your current AI literacy
- Adaptive Path: challenges personalize to your strengths and gaps
- Mastery Checks: prove competence through timed, mixed‑modality rounds
- Recognition: earn shareable badges and optional certificates aligned to real competencies

---

## 🧪 Research mode that respects people

ThinkRank’s challenges double as privacy‑preserving research tasks that advance AI safety.

- Contribute to collective understanding of bias, detection limits, and evaluation best practices
- Unlock meta‑insights that explain where and why detection succeeds or fails
- Access anonymized, aggregated learning analytics about your own progress

---

## 🛡️ Research‑only ad philosophy & data ethics

- Research‑only data use: gameplay data is used exclusively for educational research and AI safety advancement
- Privacy by design: identifiers removed, k‑anonymity and aggregation enforced, with differential privacy where appropriate
- Governance: IRB/ethics board alignment for studies; transparent data dictionaries and retention windows
- Access policy: insights are sold only to accredited universities, public benefit corporations, and mission‑aligned nonprofits
- No commercialization for profit: no ad targeting, no sale to ad networks, no data brokering
- Compliance: GDPR/CCPA supported; export/erase on request; clear in‑app consent and controls

Read the full policy in the in‑app Privacy Center at launch.
